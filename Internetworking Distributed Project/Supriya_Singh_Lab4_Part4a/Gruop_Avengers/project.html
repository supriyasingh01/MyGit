<p><b>Concept -</b> We have used UDP as it is fast, so it gives a higher throughput. However, UDP is unreliable,
so we have ensured that the file is transferred correctly and reliably over the link by implementing re-
transmission and timeouts.
</p>
<p>

<b>Design</b> - We have a multithreaded server (receiver) and client (sender) as follows -

</p>
<p>

<b>Server</b> <a href="server_udp.c">Server source code </a>

<p>
The main thread accepts the packets and sends acknowledgements for the received packets. If after
receiving packet n, it receives packet n+2, it realizes that packet n+1 is missing and it stores it in a
missing packet queue. If it receives a repeat packet, an acknowledgement is still sent.
</p>

<p>Another thread on the server copies the data from the received packets into the file. It also takes care of
the ordering of data.
</p>

<b>Client</b> <a href="client_udp.c">Client source code </a>

<p>
The main thread reads from the file and sends the packets. It adds the sent packets to the
retransmission queue. Second thread receives acknowledgements sent by the server and removes the
acknowledged packets from the retransmission queue. Third thread re-transmits packets from the re-
transmission queue at timeout intervals.
</p>

<p>
All the packets, acknowledgements and re-transmitted packets are sent by UDP.
</p>
<b>Analysis </b>
<p align="justify">
--We have used UDP for a higher throughput and then introduced mechanism to prevent packet
loss.</br>

--We have kept the packet size at 1466 bytes to avoid fragmentation while transmission.
Throughput will decrease if the packet size is increased.
</br>

--Major factor is the re-transmission mechanism used. In this lab, we have experimented with
selective repeat. We keep accepting packets as the sender sends them and we retransmit the
unacknowledged &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp packets to ensure the correctness of the file.
</br>

--The rate at which the sender sends the packets is higher than the rate at which the receiver
receives them, which is why there is packet loss even on lossless link. For Part B of this lab, we
are planning to &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp introduce a mechanism where there is an exponential change in the sender’s
window size corresponding to the packet loss.
