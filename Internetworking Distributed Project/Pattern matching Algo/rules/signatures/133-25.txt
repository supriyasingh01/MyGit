Summary:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

--
Impact:
Unknown. This is an indication of anomalous behaviour between networked assets.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

An Open AndX or Nt Create AndX command is used to open/create a file or named pipe. (The preprocessor is only interested in named pipes as this is where DCE/RPC requests are written to.) The Close command is used to close that file or named pipe. The combination of a Open AndX or Nt Create AndX command with a chained Close command, essentially opens and closes the named pipe in the same request and is anomalous behavior.  The preprocessor will generate this event if it sees this.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.
