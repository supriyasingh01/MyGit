Sid:
14777

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the client_firewall is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple vulnerabilities in SYMDNS.SYS for Symantec Norton Internet Security and Professional 2002 through 2004, Norton Personal Firewall 2002 through 2004, Norton AntiSpam 2004, Client Firewall 5.01 and 5.1.1, and Client Security 1.0 through 2.0 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via (1) a manipulated length byte in the first-level decoding routine for NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) that modifies an index variable and leads to a stack-based buffer overflow, (2) a heap-based corruption problem in an NBNS response that is missing certain RR fields, and (3) a stack-based buffer overflow in the DNS component via a Resource Record (RR) with a long canonical name (CNAME) field composed of many smaller components.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the client_firewall ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can host a web site that will return code of their choosing to the object when a victim clicks on a malicious link.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
