Sid:
14038

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the iPrint Client is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in a certain ActiveX control in ienipp.ocx in Novell iPrint Client for Windows before 4.36 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long value of the (1) operation, (2) printer-url, or (3) target-frame parameter.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

--
Affected Systems:
