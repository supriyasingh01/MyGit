3517

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
buffer overflow associated with Computer Associates License
software.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow of the host and
the subsequent execution of arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
Computer Associates License software allows a site to maintain and
handle licenses for CA products.  A server runs the software to
facilitate this and it communicates with clients/agents on the
network. A vulnerability exists in the PUTOLF message that exchanges
data with a listening server or client.

The PUTOLF message allocates fixed-sized buffers for some of the values
supplied to it.  No validation is performed by the receiving host to
ensure that the data received fits in the allocated buffer(s).  If the
received data cannot fit in the buffer, an overflow occurs and execution
of arbitrary code on the vulnerable host is possible.

--
Affected Systems:
CA License 1.0.15, 1.53-57, 1.60, 1.60.2, 1.60.3, 1.61, 1.61.1, 1.61.2,
           1.61.8

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft a PUTOLF message with overly long data, causing
a buffer overflow on the vulnerable listening CA License server or
client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
