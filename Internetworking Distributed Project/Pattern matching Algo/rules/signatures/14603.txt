--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the activereports is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Absolute path traversal vulnerability in the Data Dynamics DDActiveReports2.ActiveReport.2 (ActiveReports) ActiveX control in arpro2.dll in ActiveReports 2.0 Professional Edition 2.5.0.1308 (SP5 RC) allows remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a full pathname in an argument to the SaveLayout method.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
