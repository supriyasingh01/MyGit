--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer
overflow associated with an Internet Explorer client invoking the
javaprxy.dll COM module.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow on a client and permit
the execution of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the current
user.

--
Detailed Information:
Internet Explorer does not properly handle a COM object known as
javaprxy.dll that is installed on hosts that run Microsoft Java Machine.
When this COM object is invoked through a web page, the contents of the
web page are copied to shared memory on the client host. When the web
page contains a large amount of data, a buffer overflow can occur.

In order to avoid potential evasion techniques, http_inspect should be
configured with "flow_depth 0" so that all HTTP server response traffic
is inspected.

WARNING
Setting flow_depth 0 will cause performance problems in some situations.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to visit a malicious site that returns
code to invoke the javaprxy.dll COM module with a large amount of data
in the HTML page.  This may cause a buffer overflow, enabling execution
of arbitrary code on a vulnerable client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.
