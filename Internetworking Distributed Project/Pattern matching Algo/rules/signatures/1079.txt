Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to use the PROPFIND WebDAV request method on a web server.

--
Impact:
Information gathering. An attacker can get a directory listing for all directories configured to support WebDAV in an Apache web server. This could by a prelude to a more serious attack.

--
Detailed Information:
WebDAV is a web publishing protocol implemented by several web servers, including Apache.  Certain configurations of Apache, such as those in SuSE 6.0-7.0 and RedHat 6.2-7.0, have WebDAV enabled and misconfigured in such a way to allow directory listings of the entire server file structure -- specificially, WebDAV was enabled on the Document Root of the web server.  Since subdirectories of a WebDAV-enabled directory are automatically enabled as well, this caused the entire web server to have WebDAV enabled.

Since a directory, or its parent directory, must have been specifically declared for WebDAV to be enabled, configuration errors should be straightforward to find and correct.

Updated information on an additional vulnerability in Microsoft IIS:

The WebDAV Message Handler for Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, 5.1, and 6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU exhaustion, application crash) via a PROPFIND request with an XML message containing XML elements with a large number of attributes.

--
Affected Systems:
Apache Web Server with WebDAV enabled and misconfigured.
Microsoft Internet Information Services versions 5.0, 5.1 and 6.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
Attacker gets a listing by sending something like: PROPFIND / HTTP/1.1

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Requires that the attacker hand-craft an HTTP request.

--
False Positives:
Legitimate web publishers may use PROPFIND commands, this should not be allowed from resources external to the protected network.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Examine the packet to determine whether this was likely an attack or not.

Try to determine whether this was from a legitimate web publisher or not.

Try to determine whether the target web server was Apache with WebDAV enabled and misconfigured.

Disallow this method of publishing from resources external to the protected network.
