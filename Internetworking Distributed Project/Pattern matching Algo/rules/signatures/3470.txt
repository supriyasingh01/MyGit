3470

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
buffer overflow associated with RealPlayer.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow of the client
host and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code at the
privilege of the current user.

--
Detailed Information:
The RealPlayer media player is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability
when handling oversize lengths in the VIDORV30 Media Properties header
field. A fixed-sized buffer is allocated for the value supplied to this
attribute, however there is no check to ensure that the supplied value
fits in the allocated buffer. A buffer overflow occurs when the length
of the supplied value is greater than the fixed-size buffer.

In order to avoid potential evasion techniques, http_inspect
should be configured with "flow_depth 0" so that all HTTP
server response traffic is inspected.

WARNING
Setting flow_depth 0 will cause performance problems in some situations.
