5997

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability in Blue Coat WinProxy or ProxyAV.

--
Impact:
Serious. Code execution in the context of the user running the service is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Blue Coat WinProxy and ProxyAV are prone to a buffer overflow condition when processing overly-long host header information. This is due to poor validation of user supplied input to the service.

An attacker can supply a long Host header to overflow a static buffer and then execute code of their choosing on an affected host.

--
Affected Systems:
Blue Coat WinProxy 6.1a and prior
Blue Coat ProxyAV 2.4.2.3 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker could supply a host header containing an abnormally long port value in the form www.foo.bar:12312312312312312 to cause the overflow condition to occur. The attacker could then possibly execute code of their choosing on the affected host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Check the host for signs of compromise.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
