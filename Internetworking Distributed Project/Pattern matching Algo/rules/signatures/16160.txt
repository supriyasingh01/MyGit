Sid:
16160

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the Visual C++ is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

The Active Template Library (ATL) in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 SP1, Visual Studio 2005 SP1 and 2008 Gold and SP1, and Visual C++ 2005 SP1 and 2008 Gold and SP1; and Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP2, Vista Gold, SP1, and SP2, and Server 2008 Gold and SP2; does not properly restrict use of OleLoadFromStream in instantiating objects from data streams, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document with an ATL (1) component or (2) control, related to ATL headers and bypassing security policies, aka "ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability."

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
