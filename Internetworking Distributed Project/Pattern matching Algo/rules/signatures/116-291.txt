116-291

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service.   

--
Detailed Information:
Memory leak in the ipip6_rcv function in net/ipv6/sit.c in the Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.36.5 and 2.6 before 2.6.25.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via network traffic to a Simple Internet Transition (SIT) tunnel interface, related to the pskb_may_pull and kfree_skb functions, and management of an skb reference count.

This event indicates that IPV6 is being tunneled over IPv4, but the IPv6 header is truncated.

This event can be controlled using the ((snort decode)) configuration options.
