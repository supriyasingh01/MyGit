Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an Oracle database server.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Possible execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an Oracle database implementation. Multiple buffer overflow conditions are present in numerous packages and procedures.

Specifically an attempt has been made to cause a buffer overflow in the FTP component of an Oracle XML (XDB) server.

Exploitation of these vulnerable procedures may allow an attacker to execute code of their choosing as the user running the database. In the case of databases running on Microsoft Windows platforms, this is the Local System account which may mean a compromise of the operating system as well as the database.

--
Affected Systems:
Oracle Oracle9i

--
Attack Scenarios: 
If an attacker can supply enough data to the password parameter, it may be possible to cause the overflow condition to occur and present the attacker with the opportunity to execute code of their choosing.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch
