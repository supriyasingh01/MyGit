Sid: 
119-2

-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when the pre-processor http_inspect detects network traffic that may constitute an attack.

-- 
Impact: 
Unknown. This may be an attempt to evade an IDS.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when double encoded characters are detected in web traffic. This is abnormal behavior and may be an indicator of a possible attack against a vulnerable system.

This may also be an attempt to evade an IDS.

Note: This pre-processor is designed to detect attacks aimed at servers, it needs to be configured to monitor for the servers being protected.  Outbound client traffic may result in a high rate of false positive events.

This event can be controlled using the ((http_inspect)) configuration options.

--
Affected Systems:
 Microsoft IIS Servers.

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker might double encode the request to the web server, this may then evade an IDS monitoring traffic and could then launch a successful attack without being detected.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple. Exploits exist.

-- 

False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

-- 

Corrective Action:
Check the target host for signs of compromise.

Apply any appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software

Use Apache.
