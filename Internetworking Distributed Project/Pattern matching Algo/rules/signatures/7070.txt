--
Sid:
7070

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a cross site scripting vulnerability.

--
Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized administrative access to the server or application. Possible execution of arbitrary code of the attackers choosing in some cases.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit a cross site scripting vulnerability in an application running on a webserver.

If stringent input checks are not performed by the CGI application, it may also be possible for an attacker to retrieve sensitive data, execute system binaries or malicious code of the attackers choosing.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems running CGI applications.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a malicious link designed to steal information from a user clicking on that link.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
This is a generic rule and therefore may have a higher than normal incidence of false positives under normal circumstances. Care should be taken to tune carefully to avoid this situation.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has had all vendor supplied patches applied.
