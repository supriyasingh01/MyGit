Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in quicktime.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Heap-based buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime before 7.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malformed elements when parsing (1) Poly type (0x0070 through 0x0074) and (2) PackBitsRgn field (0x0099) opcodes in a PICT image.

--
Affected Systems:
apple quicktime 7.2

--
Attack Scenarios:
In an integer overflow attack, the attacker is able to control an integer value that can be made to be too large to store appropriately. The value may then wrap to become a small or negative value. At best this may cause a Denial of Service to occur, at worst this could lead to a buffer overflow which then allows the attacker to execute code on the system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
