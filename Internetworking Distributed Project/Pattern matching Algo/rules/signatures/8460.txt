--
Sid:
8460

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Microsoft systems using Server Message Block (SMB). In particular this rule generates an event when an attempt is made to exploit the rename function.

--
Impact:

--
Detailed Information:
SMB is a client - server protocol used in sharing resources such as files, printers, ports, named pipes and other things, between machines on a network.

A vulnerability in the Microsoft implementation of SMB exists due to a programming error which may present an attacker with the opportunity to exploit the service and run code of their choosing on an affected system. The attacker may also cause a DoS condition in the service or possibly gain unauthorized access to the target host.

In particular this rule generates an event when an attempt is made to exploit the rename function.
