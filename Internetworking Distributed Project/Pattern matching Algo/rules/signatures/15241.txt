Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in vlc_media_player.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. Complete admin access.

--
Detailed Information:
Integer overflow in the ReadRealIndex function in real.c in the Real demuxer plugin in VideoLAN VLC media player 0.9.0 through 0.9.7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed RealMedia (.rm) file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

--
Affected Systems:
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.0
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.1
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.2
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.3
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.4
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.5
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.6
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.7
videolan vlc_media_player 0.9.8

--
Attack Scenarios:
In an integer overflow attack, the attacker is able to control an integer value that can be made to be too large to store appropriately. The value may then wrap to become a small or negative value. At best this may cause a Denial of Service to occur, at worst this could lead to a buffer overflow which then allows the attacker to execute code on the system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
