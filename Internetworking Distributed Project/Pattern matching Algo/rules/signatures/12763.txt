Sid:
12763

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the Yahoo Toolbar is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Stack-based buffer overflow in the Helper class in the yt.ythelper.2 ActiveX control in Yahoo! Toolbar 1.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (browser crash) via a long argument to the c method.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the Yahoo Toolbar ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can host a web site that will return code of their choosing to the object when a victim clicks on a malicious link.

--
Ease of Attack:
