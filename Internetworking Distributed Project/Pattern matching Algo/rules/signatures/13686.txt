13686

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the ChilkatHttp ActiveX is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

The ChilkatHttp.ChilkatHttp.1 and ChilkatHttp.ChilkatHttpRequest.1 ActiveX controls in ChilkatHttp.dll 2.4.0.0, 2.3.0.0, and earlier in ChilkatHttp ActiveX expose the unsafe SaveLastError method, which allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the ChilkatHttp ActiveX ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
