Attack Scenarios:
Viruses may propogate in many different ways. Many arrive in the form of email attachments that an unsuspecting user may trigger by opening the attachment. Once infected, many viruses have the ability to use the infected host as a means of spreading copies of itself to other machines on the protected and external networks.

This particular virus is able to spread using an exploit for MS08-067 and as such, rules that detect exploits targeting this vulnerability may also generate events.
