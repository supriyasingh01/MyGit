Summary:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

--
Impact:
Unknown. This is an indication of anomalous behaviour between networked assets.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

Some commands require a minimum number of bytes after the command header. If a command requires this and the byte count is less than the minimum required byte count for that command, the preprocessor will generate this event.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems using NetBIOS DCERPC or SMB file and print sharing

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to specify an invalid byte count for a particular command.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
