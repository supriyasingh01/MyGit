Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Apple QuickTime.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code leading to unauthorized administrative access to the target host.

--
Detailed Information:
A programming error in certain versions of Apple QuickTime may allow an attacker to run code of their choosing on a victim host. Apple QuickTime contains a programming error that may allow a remote attacker to take advantage of an integer overflow condition. A QuickTime file containing malformed movie attributes may expose the condition for exploitation.

In order to avoid potential evasion techniques, http_inspect should be configured with "flow_depth 0" so that all HTTP server response traffic is inspected.

WARNING
Setting flow_depth 0 will cause performance problems in some situations.
