Sid:
15859

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the ISA Server is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Buffer overflow in the Office Web Components ActiveX Control in Microsoft Office XP SP3, Office 2000 Web Components SP3, Office XP Web Components SP3, BizTalk Server 2002, and Visual Studio .NET 2003 SP1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted property values, aka "Office Web Components Buffer Overflow Vulnerability."

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
