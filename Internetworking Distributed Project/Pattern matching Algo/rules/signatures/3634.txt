--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit an
integer overflow associated with Mozilla's processing of a
malformed BMP file.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a heap overflow on the client host
running Mozilla and permit execution of arbitrary code at the
privilege level of the current user.

--
Detailed Information:
The Mozilla browser is vulnerable to an integer overflow when processing
images in Bitmap (BMP) format. Programming errors may present an
attacker with the opportunity to cause the integer overflow due to
insufficient bounds checking in the code that handles bitmap images.

--
Affected Systems:
	Mozilla Thunderbird 0.73 and prior
	Mozilla Firefox 0.9.3 and prior
	Mozilla browser 1.7.2 and prior
	Netscape Navigator 7.2 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to view a malicious BMP file that causes
the overflow, enabling execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
