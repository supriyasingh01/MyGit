Sid:
3693

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow associated with the IBM WebSphere Application Server mishandling of authentication variable values.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow on a vulnerable IBM WebSphere server, permitting the execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.

--
Detailed Information:
IBM WebSphere may use form-based authentication to permit access to applications.  The CGI variables j_username and j_password are used for this authentication process.  Overly long values passed to these variables can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.  This is due to a failure in the code to accommodate wide-character expansion for the receiving buffer.

--
Affected Systems:
IBM WebSphere Application Server 5.0 through 5.0.2 without Cumulative Fix 11

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send a malformed request that contains an overly long value for a vulnerable authentication variable.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
