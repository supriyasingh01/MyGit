Summary:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

--
Impact:
Unknown. This is an indication of anomalous behaviour between networked assets.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

With AndX command chaining it is possible to chain multiple Session Setup AndX commands within the same request. There is, however, only one place in the SMB header to return a login handle (or Uid).  Windows does not allow this behavior, however Samba does. This is anomalous behavior and the preprocessor will generate this event if it happens.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.
