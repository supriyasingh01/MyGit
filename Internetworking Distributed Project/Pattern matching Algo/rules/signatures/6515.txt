Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability in Asterisk IAX2.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Code execution is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Asterisk IAX2 is prone to a buffer overflow condition that presents itself when the application copies user-supplied data into a fixed length buffer.

Due to a programming error, user-supplied data is not properly checked.  An attacker may be able to exploit this condition to execute code of their choosing on the affected host.

--
Affected Systems:
Asterisk IAX2

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker need only supply excess data to the application to overflow the buffer, code execution is then possible.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple,

-- 
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
