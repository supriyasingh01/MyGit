Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Omni-NFS server.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of code is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
The Omni-NFS server, an NFS server for Windows, suffers from a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the MachineName parameter of UNIX authentication data in RPC mount packets.

These packets are laid out as such:

* 4-byte fragment header (present in TCP packets, not UDP)
* 4-byte XID
* 4-byte message type (must be 0, or call, in our case)
* 4-byte RPC version (must be 2 in our case)
* 4-byte program ID (must be |00 01 86 A5|, or MOUNT, in our case)
* 4-byte program version
* 4-byte procedure type
* 4-byte authentication flavor (must be 1, or AUTH_UNIX, in our case)
* 4-byte length (does not appear relevant here)
* 4-byte stamp
* 4-byte length of MachineName string
* n-byte MachineName string
* 4-byte UID
* 4-byte GID
* 16-member array of 4-byte GIDs

According to the RFC, the MachineName string may be no more than 255 bytes.

--
Affected Systems:
Omni-NFS 5.2

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker needs to supply excess data in a transaction using the application. The attacker may then include code of their choosing to be executed on the host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
