--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. Complete admin access.

Detailed Information:
The WebTextRenderer(WebInternal) _CG_drawRun:style:geometry: function in Apple Safari 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an HTML LI tag with a large VALUE attribute (list item number), which triggers a null dereference in QPainter::drawText, probably due to a failed memory allocation that uses the VALUE.

Apple Safari 2.0.1
Apple Safari 2.0.2
