16336

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the blackberry enterprise server is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the PDF distiller in the Attachment Service component in Research In Motion (RIM) BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) software 4.1.3 through 5.0 and BlackBerry Professional Software 4.1.4 allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .pdf file attachment, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-3246 and CVE-2009-0219.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
