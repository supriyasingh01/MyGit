Sid:
3-15083

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the office is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Microsoft Office Word 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, 2003 SP3, and 2007 Gold and SP1; Outlook 2007 Gold and SP1; Word Viewer 2003 Gold and SP3; Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Gold and SP1; and Office 2004 for Mac allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malformed control words in (1) an RTF file or (2) a rich text e-mail message, which triggers a "memory calculation error" and memory corruption, aka "Word RTF Object Parsing Vulnerability."

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the office ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
In an integer overflow attack, the attacker is able to control an integer value that can be made to be too large to store appropriately. The value may then wrap to become a small or negative value. At best this may cause a Denial of Service to occur, at worst this could lead to a buffer overflow which then allows the attacker to execute code on the system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
