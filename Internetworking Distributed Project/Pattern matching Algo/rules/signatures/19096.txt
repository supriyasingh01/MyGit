--
Detailed Information:
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, Apple Safari before 4.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, and Google Chrome before 5.0.375.70 does not properly handle a transformation of a text node that has the IBM1147 character set, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML document containing a BR element, related to a "type checking issue."
