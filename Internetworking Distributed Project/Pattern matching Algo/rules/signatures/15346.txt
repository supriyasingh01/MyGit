--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the all_in_the_box.ocx is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

The SaveDoc method in the All_In_The_Box.AllBox ActiveX control in ALL_IN_THE_BOX.OCX in Synactis ALL In-The-Box ActiveX 3 allows remote attackers to create and overwrite arbitrary files via an argument ending in a '\0' character, which bypasses the intended .box filename extension, as demonstrated by a C:\boot.ini\0 argument.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the all_in_the_box.ocx ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
