Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in keyview export sdk.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. Complete admin access.

--
Detailed Information:
Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Autonomy (formerly Verity) KeyView SDK before 9.2.0, as used in Lotus Notes 6.5.4 and 7.0, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a UUE file containing an encoded file with a long filename handled by uudrdr.dll, (2) a compressed ZIP file with a long filename handled by kvarcve.dll, (3) a TAR archive with a long filename that is extracted to a directory with a long path handled by the TAR reader (tarrdr.dll), (4) an email that contains a long HTTP, FTP, or // link handled by the HTML speed reader (htmsr.dll) or (5) an email containing a crafted long link handled by the HTML speed reader (htmsr.dll).

Affected Systems:

Attack Scenarios:
Many types of buffer overflow exist, this is a generic term that may apply to many circumstances that result in an overflow of some kind. A parameter overflow for example, means that the attacker is able to supply data as a parameter to the execution of a program. When the program expands the supplied data, if the size of the parameter is not correctly checked, it may exceed a set limit allowing the attacker to overflow the buffer and write data into memory.
In a stack overflow, the attacker has the opportunity to overwrite a return memory address which allows them to point the return address to a memory location containing code they wish to execute. This allows the attacker to run code with the full privileges of the program in use. The attacker may also supply the address for a known important call, for example the system() call, with the arguments to the call on the stack. The stack also contains the stack pointer and the frame pointer, overwriting these values may lead to a write-what-where condition.
In a heap overflow, it is possible to overwrite function pointers that may be in memory. This may allow the attacker to execute code in memory by changing the function pointer to move to code of their choosing. This can occur even in programs that do not necessarily use function pointers since they may be left in memory at run time. The heap also contains user data which also becomes visible to the attacker.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
