Sid:
16581

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the virtual office is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Buffer overflow in the XUpload.ocx ActiveX control in Persits Software XUpload 2.1.0.1, and probably other versions before 3.0, as used by HP Mercury LoadRunner and Groove Virtual Office, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long argument to the AddFolder function.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
