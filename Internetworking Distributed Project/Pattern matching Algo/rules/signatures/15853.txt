Sid:
15853

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the isa_server is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

The Office Web Components ActiveX Control in Microsoft Office XP SP3, Office 2003 SP3, Office XP Web Components SP3, Office 2003 Web Components SP3, Office 2003 Web Components SP1 for the 2007 Microsoft Office System, Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2004 SP3 and 2006 SP1, and Office Small Business Accounting 2006 does not properly allocate memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that trigger "system state" corruption, aka "Office Web Components Memory Allocation Vulnerability."

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
