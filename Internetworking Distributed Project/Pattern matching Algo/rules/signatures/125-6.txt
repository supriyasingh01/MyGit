Summary:
This event is generated when the ftptelnet preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
In particular, the preprocessor has detected an anomaly in a response from an FTP server in that the response is over-sized.

This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Ace-FTP.

Buffer overflow in Ace-FTP Client 1.24a allows user-assisted, remote FTP servers to execute arbitrary code via a long response.

--
Affected Systems:
Visicom Media Ace-FTP 1.24a

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to send an overly long response to an FTP client request and then supply code of their choosing to that client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Medium.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
