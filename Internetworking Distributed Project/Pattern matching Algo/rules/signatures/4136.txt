Rule:

--
Sid:
4136

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Internet Explorer using a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format image.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may result in the execution of code of the attackers choosing possibly leading to control of the target machine.

--
Detailed Information:
Internet Explorer does not correctly handle JPEG images. Proper bounds checking of input data is not carried out by the application when processing JPEG images. This can lead to a buffer overflow condition and an opportunity for an attacker to execute code of their choosing.

Note:
For this rule to generate an event correctly, sid 2706 must be enabled.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP2 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to visit a web server that will return a malicious JPEG file, perhaps enabling the execution of the malicious code when the file is opened.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is publicly available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches as they become available.
