Sid:
17556

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the firebird is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Integer overflow in Firebird SQL 1.0.3 and earlier, 1.5.x before 1.5.6, 2.0.x before 2.0.4, and 2.1.x before 2.1.0 RC1 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted (1) op_receive, (2) op_start, (3) op_start_and_receive, (4) op_send, (5) op_start_and_send, and (6) op_start_send_and_receive XDR requests, which triggers memory corruption.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
