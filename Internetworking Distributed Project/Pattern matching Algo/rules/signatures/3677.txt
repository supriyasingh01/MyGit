Sid: 
3677

-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Ethereal. In particular, this event indicates that the
exploit was attempted via the processing of tcp packets in a SIP
protocol transaction.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
Ethereal is a multi-platform network protocol analyser capable of
displaying network data to the user in a graphical user interface.

An error in the processing of tcp packets in a SIP protocol transaction
may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition in Ethereal. The SIP
parsing routine does not properly check the length of data supplied to a
fixed length buffer in the processing of the SIP data.

--
Affected Systems:
	Ethereal 0.10.0 through 0.10.10

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker needs to craft packet data containing large amounts of data
in the CSeq field of a SIP packet. Once processed by Ethereal, the
overflow will occur.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
