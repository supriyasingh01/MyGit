--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow associated with the Ethereal decode of the Internet Group membership Authentication Protocol (IGAP).

--
Impact:
A successful attack may allow the execution of arbitrary code as root or LOCAL_SYSTEM privilege on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
There is a vulnerability associated with particular versions of Ethereal that may cause a buffer overflow when a malformed IGAP packet is decoded using Ethereal or tethereal.  This may permit the execution of arbitrary code with root or LOCAL_SYSTEM privilege.  The buffer overflow occurs when a larger than expected User Account Size value is discovered in the IGAP payload.

--
Affected Systems:
Any host running Ethereal/tethereal versions 0.10.0 - 0.10.2. 

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create and send a malformed IGAP packet, and if decoded by a vulnerable version of Ethereal/tethereal, can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Update to version 0.10.3 of Ethereal.
