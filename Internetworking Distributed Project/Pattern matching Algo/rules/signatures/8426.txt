Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an OpenSSL implementation.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of code is possible. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
OpenSSL libraries are prone to a buffer overflow condition when processing user input. The SSL_Get_Shared_Ciphers function reads data into a fixed length portion of memory, an attacker could utilize this vulnerability to execute code of their choosing on an affected system.

Applications using the OpenSSL libraries may also be prone to a DoS condition.

--
Affected Systems:
OpenSSL libraries prior to 0.9.8d
OpenSSL libraries prior to 0.9.7l

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply excess data in the cipher exchange with a remote server to cause the overflow condition to be met.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected OpenSSL libraries and recompile any software that uses the libraries.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
