Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows 7 or Adobe Acrobat.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Integer overflow in cdd.dll in the Canonical Display Driver (CDD) in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 on 64-bit platforms, when the Windows Aero theme is installed, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image file that triggers incorrect data parsing after user-mode data is copied to kernel mode, as demonstrated using "Browse with Irfanview" and certain actions on a folder containing a large number of thumbnail images in Resample mode, possibly related to the ATI graphics driver or win32k.sys, aka "Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability."

Integer overflow in Adobe Acrobat 9.x before 9.2, 8.x before 8.1.7, and possibly 7.x through 7.1.4 might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.
