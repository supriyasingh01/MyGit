3696

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
denial of service associated with a malformed Veritas Backup
Agent request.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause the Vertias Backup Agent service
to crash.

--
Detailed Information:
The Veritas Backup Agent Exec provides backup software.  Certain
communication is done via Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP).
The NDMP protocol does not properly handle malformed requests that
have a non-zero error code value.  When this condition is
encountered, memory is not allocated, but processing continues as
if it were.  When an attempt is made to read from this buffer, an
access violation occurs and the Backup Agent service is terminated.

Affected Systems:
	Veritas Software Backup Exec 9.0, 9.1, 10.0

--
Attack Scenarios:

causing it to crash.

--
Ease of Attack:

--
False Positives:
None known.
