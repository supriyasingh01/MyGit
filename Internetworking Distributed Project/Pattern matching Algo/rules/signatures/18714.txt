Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in openssl.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
The ssl3_get_record function in ssl/s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8m allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed record in a TLS connection that triggers a NULL pointer dereference, related to the minor version number.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

--
Affected Systems:
openssl openssl 0.9.8f
openssl openssl 0.9.8g
openssl openssl 0.9.8h
openssl openssl 0.9.8i
openssl openssl 0.9.8j
openssl openssl 0.9.8k
openssl openssl 0.9.8l
openssl openssl 0.9.8m

--
Attack Scenarios:
If an application does not correctly enforce access control, a remote attacker may be able to view resources and data that should be protected. Additionally, in the case of administrative user interfaces, the attacker may be able to elevate privileges and generate accounts by accessing functions that should be controllled by ACLs.

--
Ease of Attack:
Medium.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
