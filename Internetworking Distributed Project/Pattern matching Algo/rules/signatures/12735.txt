Sid:
12735

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the FlexGrid is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the VSFlexGrid.VSFlexGridL ActiveX control in ComponentOne FlexGrid 7.1 Light allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long string in the (1) Text, (2) EditSelText, (3) EditText, and (4) CellFontName property values.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the FlexGrid ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can host a web site that will return code of their choosing to the object when a victim clicks on a malicious link.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.
