Sid:
12771

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the Storm is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple buffer overflows in the BaoFeng2 storm ActiveX control in Mps.dll allow remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a long (1) URL, (2) backImage, or (3) titleImage property value; (4) a long first argument to the advancedOpen method; a long argument to the (5) isDVDPath or (6) rawParse method; or (7) a .smpl file with a long path attribute in an item element in a PlayList.

--
