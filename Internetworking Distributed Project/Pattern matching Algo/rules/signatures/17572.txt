Sid:
17572

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the internet explorer is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Cross-domain vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0 and 4.0, as used in Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from another domain via a crafted XML document, related to improper error checks for external DTDs, aka "MSXML DTD Cross-Domain Scripting Vulnerability."

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
