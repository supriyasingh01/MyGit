13787

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the HanGamePluginCn18_ActiveX control is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the HanGamePluginCn18.HanGamePluginCn18.1 ActiveX control in HanGamePluginCn18.dll in Ourgame GLWorld 2.6.1.29 (aka Lianzong Game Platform) allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long arguments to the (1) hgs_startGame and (2) hgs_startNotify methods, as exploited in the wild as of February 2008.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
