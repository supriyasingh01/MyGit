Sid:
14025

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the unicenter_desktop_management_bundle is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

The DSM gui_cm_ctrls ActiveX control (gui_cm_ctrls.ocx), as used in multiple CA products including BrightStor ARCServe Backup for Laptops and Desktops r11.5, Desktop Management Suite r11.1 through r11.2 C2; Unicenter r11.1 through r11.2 C2; and Desktop and Server Management r11.1 through r11.2 C2 allows remote attackers to execute abritrary code via crafted function arguments.
