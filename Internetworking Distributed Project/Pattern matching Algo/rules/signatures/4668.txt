Rule:

--
Sid:


--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Samba. In particular this rule generates an event when an attempt is made to exploit the function "nt_trans" via the "NT SET SECURITY DESC" command.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code leading to unauthorized administrative access to the target host. Denial of Service (DoS) is also possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Samba is a file and print service for Linux and UNIX style systems. It is normally used to provide networked file and print services for Windows and other operating systems.

A vulnerability in Samba exists due to a programming error which may present an attacker with the opportunity to exploit the service and run code of their choosing on an affected system. The attacker may also cause a DoS condition in the service or possibly gain unauthorized access to the target host.

A malicious attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious request to a server that contains a large number of security descriptor requests. This may result in the overflow of a static buffer which can lead to the attacker having the opportunity to execute code of their choosing.

In particular this rule generates an event when an attempt is made to exploit the function "nt_trans" via the "NT SET SECURITY DESC" command.

--
Affected Systems:
Samba 3.0.8 and prior.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a large number of security descriptor requests in a connection to the Samba daemon.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
