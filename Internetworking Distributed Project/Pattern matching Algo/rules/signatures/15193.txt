Sid:
15193

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the sizerone is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the AddTab method in the (1) Tab and (2) CTab ActiveX controls in c1sizer.ocx and the (3) TabOne ActiveX control in sizerone.ocx in ComponentOne SizerOne 8.0.20081.140, as used in ComponentOne Studio for ActiveX 2008, TSC2 Help Desk 4.1.8, SAP GUI 6.40 Patch 29 and 7.10, and possibly other products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by adding many tabs, or adding tabs with long tab captions.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the sizerone ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can host a web site that will return code of their choosing to the object when a victim clicks on a malicious link.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
