--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the  is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Heap-based buffer overflow in the Microsoft Terminal Services Client ActiveX control running RDP 6.1 on Windows XP SP2, Vista SP1 or SP2, or Server 2008 Gold or SP2; or 5.2 or 6.1 on Windows XP SP3; allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified parameters to unknown methods, aka "Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX Control Heap Overflow Vulnerability."

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
