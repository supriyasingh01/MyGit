Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in shockwave player.

Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
The Director module (dirapi.dll) in Adobe Shockwave player 11.5.8.612, and probably other versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Directory movie with a crafted rcsL chunk containing a field whose value is used as a pointer offset, which triggers memory corruption.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
