Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Safari.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. Complete admin access.

--
Detailed Information:
Apple Safari on Mac OS X, and before 3.1.2 on Windows, does not prompt the user before downloading an object that has an unrecognized content type, which allows remote attackers to place malware into the (1) Desktop directory on Windows or (2) Downloads directory on Mac OS X, aka a "Carpet Bomb," a different issue than CVE-2008-1032. NOTE: Apple considers this a vulnerability only because of certain behavior of the Windows desktop and, as of 20080619, has not covered the issue in an advisory for Mac OS X.  NOTE: Microsoft describes the issue on the Windows platform as "a blended threat that allows remote code execution."
