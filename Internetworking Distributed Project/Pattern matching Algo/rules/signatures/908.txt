--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the administrator screens for Coldfusion server.  A long password can cause a Denial-of-Service.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS). While the risk as a target for password attacks is minor, the administrator login mechanism can be jammed by long passwords, leading to a DoS for the server.

--
Detailed Information:
ColdFusion's administrator interface is reachable via:
http://www.target.com/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm

It is possible to create a temporary DoS condition in the application by supplying an overly large value to the password parameter during a login attempt.

--
Affected Systems:
ColdFusion versions 4.x for Windows, Solaris, HP-UX, Linux

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can access the administration interface for the server and 
gain control of the application.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
At minimum, restrict access to the administrator mechanism from within the ColdFusion administrator screens.  Only internal, trusted users should be allowed access.

For further protection, use the security capabilities of the webserver or the OS to restrict access to the CFIDE/administrator directory when not needed, or copy/remove the CFIDE/administrator directory completely from the server when not in use (it will be necessary to reload the directory before accessing admin functions, of course).
