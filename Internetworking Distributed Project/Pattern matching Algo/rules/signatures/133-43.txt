Summary:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

--
Impact:
Unknown. This is an indication of anomalous behaviour between networked assets.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

The preprocessor will generate this event if the sequence number uses in a request is the same or less than a previously used sequence number on the session.  In testing, wrapping the sequence number space produces strange behavior from the server, so this should be considered anomalous behavior.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.
