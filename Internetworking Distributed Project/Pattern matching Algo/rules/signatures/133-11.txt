--
Impact:
Unknown. This is an indication of anomalous behaviour between networked assets.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

The preprocessor will generate this event if the remaining NetBIOS packet length is less than the size of the SMB command header to be decoded.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems using NetBIOS DCERPC or SMB file and print sharing

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to supply a specially crafted packet containing a length field that is smaller than the size of the SMB command header.

--
