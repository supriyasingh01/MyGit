Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt has been made to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows Media Player. 

--
Impact:
Serious. Possible remote code execution.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows Media Player. 

Windows Media Player suffers from a programming error that may enable an attacker to run code of their choosing on a vulnerable system. The error occurs when processing malformed bitmap files with the application. A bitmap file with length zero is not correctly checked for actual length, and it may be possible for an attacker to create a malicious image with size 0 but with actual data in the image that can be copied into memory for execution.

--
Affected Systems:
All Microsoft Windows systems using Media Player
	
--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft the special bitmap image and execute code of their choosing when processed with Media Player.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches

Do not use media player as the default application for viewing media types
