Sid:
3516

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
directory traversal associated with an Oracle UTL_FILE command.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can allow a malicious user to read, write,
alter, or delete files outside the user's authorized directory.

--
Detailed Information:
Oracle UTL_FILE commands allow a user to read, write, copy, or
delete files in locations/directories authorized to the user.
However, no check is performed to examine if the user attempts
to employ a directory traversal to manipulate files outside of
the authorized directories.  Specifically, the FOPEN, FOPEN_NCHAR,
FREMOVE, FRENAME, and FCOPY commands are vulnerable to this
exploit.

Note that hosts using Microsoft Windows as the base operating system
must set the $ORACLE_PORTS variable to any to potentially avoid missing
any attacks.
