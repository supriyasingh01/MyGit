Rule:

--
Sid:
8540

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Microsoft systems using Microsoft SQL Server.

--
Impact:
Serious. Denial of Service. Code execution may be possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft SQL Server is a database platform for use on hosts using the Microsoft Windows operating system.

A vulnerability in the handling of functions available through the Extended Stored Procedures API may allow an attacker to overflow a fixed length buffer and execute code of their choosing on an affected host. A DoS condition may also result due to the server failing to handle a memory copy routine properly which may cause the server to crash.

In particular this rule generates an event when an attempt is made to exploit the function "xp_updatecolvbm".

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows SQL Server 2000

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply extra data in the message to the server via the function xp_updatecolvbm to cause the overflow condition to occur. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Use MySQL, Oracle or PostGRES as alternative database engines.
