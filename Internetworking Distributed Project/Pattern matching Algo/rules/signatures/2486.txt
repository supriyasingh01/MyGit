--
Sid:
2486

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a denial of service (DoS) associated with tcpdump decoding of an isakmp payload.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may cause a DoS of the host running tcpdump.

--
Detailed Information:
The tcpdump decode of an isakmp packet with an identification payload may be susceptible to a DoS attack.  This occurs because the code does not properly convert the payload length field from network-to-host byte order. This may cause tcpdump to crash when specific values are supplied to the payload length.

--
Affected Systems:
Hosts running tcpdump versions 3.8.1 and earlier

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create and send a malformed isakmp packet that may cause a host running tcpdump and analyzing the packet to crash.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
