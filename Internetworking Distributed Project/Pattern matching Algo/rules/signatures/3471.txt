3471

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer
overflow associated with Apple iTunes handling of a playlist file.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may permit a buffer overflow that allows the execution
of arbitrary code on the client at the privilege level of the user
receiving the malicious file.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Apple iTunes validates parameters
supplied in a playlist.  If a playlist using a PLS or M3U format contains
a file name that references an overly long URL, a buffer overflow can
occur.  This enables the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on
the client host at the privilege level of the current user.

--
Affected Systems:
	Apple iTunes 4.7 and previous versions

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to download an iTunes file containing
a playlist filename with an overly long URL. This can cause a buffer
overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable
client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
In order to avoid potential evasion techniques, http_inspect should be
configured with "flow_depth 0" so that all HTTP server response traffic is
inspected.

WARNING
Setting flow_depth 0 will cause performance problems in some situations.
