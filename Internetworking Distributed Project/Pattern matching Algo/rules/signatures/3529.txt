Sid:
3529

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a directory
traversal associated with Computer Associates License software.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can allow arbitrary files to be written or existing
files to be overwritten on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
Computer Associates License software allows a site to maintain and
handle licenses for CA products.  A server runs the software to
facilitate this and it communicates with clients/agents on the network.
A vulnerability exists in the PUTOLF message that exchanges data with a
listening server or client.

The PUTOLF allows a file to be written to the target host.  However, no
validation is performed to look for a directory traversal outside of the
authorized directory.  This may permit new files to be uploaded or
existing files to be overwritten on the target host.

--
Affected Systems:

              1.61.8

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft a PUTOLF message that contains directory traversal
characters in the filename.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.
