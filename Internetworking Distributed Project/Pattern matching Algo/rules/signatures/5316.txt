-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Remote execution of code with system level privileges is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Multiple products from Computer Associates use a common messaging system. A programming error may permit an attacker to execute code of their choosing with system level privileges on a vulnerable system.

The Computer Associates Message Queuing (CAM) system fails to properly check user supplied data. A long paramter passed to the log_security() function may allow an attacker to overflow a fixed length buffer and run code of their choosing on the target system.
