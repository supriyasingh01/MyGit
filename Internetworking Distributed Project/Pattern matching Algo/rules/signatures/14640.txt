Sid:
14640

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the digital_image is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Microsoft PicturePusher ActiveX control (PipPPush.DLL 7.00.0709), as used in Microsoft Digital Image 2006 Starter Edition, allows remote attackers to force the upload of arbitrary files by using the AddString and Post methods and a modified PostURL to construct an HTTP POST request.  NOTE: this issue might only be exploitable in limited environments or non-default browser settings.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the digital_image ActiveX control

--
