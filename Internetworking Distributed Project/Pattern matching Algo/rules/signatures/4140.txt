4140

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in tcpdump.

--
Impact:
Serious. A Denial of Service (DoS) to tcpdump.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that tcpdump processes Label
Distribution Protocol (LDP) packets. A malformed LDP packet will cause
tcpdump to enter a DoS condition when it tries to process the
information.

--
Affected Systems:
  tcpdump 3.8.3 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to construct a malformed LDP packet and transmit
across a network segment that is being monitored using tcpdump.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.

LDP can be used in conjunction with md5 signatures to verify the source
of the LDP conversation. If this option is used, it would be much more
difficult for an attacker to exploit this condition.
