Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader.

--
Impact:
Code executtion leading to complete compromise of an affected machine.

--

Buffer overflow in Adobe Reader 9.0 and earlier and Acrobat 9.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF document, related to a non-JavaScript function call, as exploited in the wild in February 2009 by Trojan.Pidief.E.

The problem occurs when Acrobat and Reader try to parse a PDF file containing an embedded JBIG2 image stream. If the bit that indicates a large page association size is set, then a buffer overflow is possible.

--
Affected Systems:
Adobe Acrobat and Reader 7.x, 8.x and 9.x on all platforms

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to supply the victim with a malicious PDF file. The file DOES NOT need to be opened for exploitation to occur.

--
Ease of Attack:
Difficult.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
