Sid:
15554

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the Application Server 10g is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Unspecified vulnerability in the OPMN component in Oracle Application Server 10.1.2.3 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the April 2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that this issue is a format string vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in an HTTP POST URI, which are not properly handled when logging to opmn/logs/opmn.log.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the Application Server 10g ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
Format string vulnerabilities can be very simple to attack. Any program that reads a format string as an input parameter can be exploited if the argument can be controlled by the attacker.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
