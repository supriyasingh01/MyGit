Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in cups.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Integer overflow in the _cupsImageReadPNG function in CUPS 1.1.17 through 1.3.9 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PNG image with a large height value, which bypasses a validation check and triggers a buffer overflow.

Attack Scenarios:
In an integer overflow attack, the attacker is able to control an integer value that can be made to be too large to store appropriately. The value may then wrap to become a small or negative value. At best this may cause a Denial of Service to occur, at worst this could lead to a buffer overflow which then allows the attacker to execute code on the system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Medium.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
