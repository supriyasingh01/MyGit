--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service.   

--
Detailed Information:
Integer underflow in the firewall logging rules for iptables in Linux before 2.6.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a malformed IP packet.

This event indicates that the TCP Data Offset is less than 5.

This event can be controlled using the ((snort decode)) configuration options.
