Sid:
3821

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
vulnerability associated with Microsoft Windows Help.

--
Impact:
Serious. Code execution is possible leading to unauthorized
administrative access to the target host.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft Windows Help uses the InfoTech protocol.

A programming error in the processing of malformed InfoTech protocol
messages can lead to the exposure of a buffer overflow condition. An
attacker may be able to overflow this buffer and supply code of their
choosing to be executed on the system with the privileges of the
administrative account.

In addition, applications may treat Windows Help as a trusted program
and further exploitation and host firewall bypass may be possible.

--
Affected Systems:
	Systems using Microsoft Windows

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can overflow a buffer by sending malformed data using the
InfoTech protocol. The attacker may then insert code of their choosing
to either run commands on the system or execute the code with the
privileges of the administrative account.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
