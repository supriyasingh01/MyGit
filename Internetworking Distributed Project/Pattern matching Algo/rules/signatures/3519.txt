Sid: 
3519

-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an overly long password is sent to the MySQL MaxDB 
WebSQL service, in an attempt to cause a buffer overflow.

-- 

Impact: 
Successful attacks against a vulnerable version of this service cause a buffer 
to be overflowed. The service will crash, and an attacker may be able to 
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.

--
Detailed Information:
A password value of 294 bytes or more is sufficient to crash vulnerable 
versions of the service. This value is sent as part of an HTTP POST operation. 
This rule searches for exploits on port 9999, the default for the server.
