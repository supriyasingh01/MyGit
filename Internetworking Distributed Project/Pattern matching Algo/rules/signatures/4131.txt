Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a format
string validation problem associated with a SHOUTcast streaming server.

--
Impact:
Serious. A successful attack may cause the server to read from or write
to an invalid memory location, permitting the execution of arbitrary
code on a vulnerable server.

--
Detailed Information:
SHOUTcast is widely used free streaming audio software developed by
Nullsoft. A client can request an audio stream from the server using
HTTP protocols. A vulnerbility exists if a request contains a format
string format specifier. This can cause the server to read from or write
to an invalid memory location, allowing the execution of arbitrary code
on a vulnerable server.

--
Affected Systems:
	Nullsoft SHOUTcase versions 1.9.4 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send a malicious HTTP request containing a format string
specifier in the URI.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current nonaffected version of the software.
