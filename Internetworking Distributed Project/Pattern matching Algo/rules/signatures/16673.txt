Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in shockwave player.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
The implementation of pami RIFF chunk parsing in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.7.609 does not validate a certain value from a file before using it in file-pointer calculations, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted .dir (aka Director) file.

Attack Scenarios:
Format string vulnerabilities can be very simple to attack. Any program that reads a format string as an input parameter can be exploited if the argument can be controlled by the attacker.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
