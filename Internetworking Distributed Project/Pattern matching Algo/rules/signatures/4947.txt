4947

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability is the Microsoft Plug and Play subsystem on a host.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
A programming error in the Plug and Play (PnP) service used by Microsoft Windows machines can present a remote attacker with the opportunity to overflow a fixed length buffer, execute code on the vulnerable system and escalate privileges on the host to the extent that they could take complete control of the affected machine. This event is generated when conditions indicate that a Denial of Service condition is detected.

Specifically this event is generated when the UMPNGMGR interface is targeted via the  function.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows 2000
Microsoft Windows XP
Microsoft Windows 2003

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker merely needs to send extra data to the PnP service to overflow the buffer and cause a DoS on the affected system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Disallow access to ports 139 and 445 from sources external to the protected network.

Consider disabling the use of those ports completely on Windows based networks.
