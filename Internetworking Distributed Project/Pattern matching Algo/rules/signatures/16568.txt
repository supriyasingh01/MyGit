--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the altnet download manager is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Stack-based buffer overflow in the ADM4 ActiveX control in adm4.dll in Altnet Download Manager 4.0.0.6, as used in (1) Kazaa 3.2.7 and (2) Grokster, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long argument to the Install method.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
