Sid:
17257

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the acrobat is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Unspecified vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player 10.1.82.76 and earlier for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Solaris; Flash Player 10.1.92.10 for Android; Reader 9.3.4 for Windows, Macintosh and UNIX; and Acrobat 9.3.4 and earlier for Windows and Macintosh allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors, as exploited in the wild in September 2010.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
