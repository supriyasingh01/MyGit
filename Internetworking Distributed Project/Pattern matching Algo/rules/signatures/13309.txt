Sid:
13309

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the Apache HTTP Server is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

The date handling code in modules/proxy/proxy_util.c (mod_proxy) in Apache 2.3.0, when using a threaded MPM, allows remote origin servers to cause a denial of service (caching forward proxy process crash) via crafted date headers that trigger a buffer over-read.

--
Affected Systems:

--
