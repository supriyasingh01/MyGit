-- 
Impact: 
Denial of Service.

--
Detailed Information:
The ISC DHCP Server is prone to a Denial of Service attack that can be triggered by a DHCPDISCOVER packet. A programming error in the way that the server handles the client identifier in the packet may cause the server to incorrectly interpret the field and cause the server to exit.

The programming error is contained in the function "supersede_lease".

Affected Systems:
ISC DHCP Server 2.0p15 and possibly prior

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker can supply a 32 byte client-identifier field to a vulnerable server which causes the server to interpret the value as a corrupt uid.  This in turn cause the server to exit.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action:
