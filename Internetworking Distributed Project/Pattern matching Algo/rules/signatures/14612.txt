14612

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the ace is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Buffer overflow in a certain ActiveX control in the COM API in VMware Workstation 5.5.x before 5.5.8 build 108000, VMware Workstation 6.0.x before 6.0.5 build 109488, VMware Player 1.x before 1.0.8 build 108000, VMware Player 2.x before 2.0.5 build 109488, VMware ACE 1.x before 1.0.7 build 108880, VMware ACE 2.x before 2.0.5 build 109488, and VMware Server before 1.0.7 build 108231 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (browser crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a call to the GuestInfo method in which there is a long string argument, and an assignment of a long string value to the result of this call.  NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2008-3691, CVE-2008-3692, CVE-2008-3693, CVE-2008-3694, CVE-2008-3695, or CVE-2008-3696.
