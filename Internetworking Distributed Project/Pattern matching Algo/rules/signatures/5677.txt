--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in ISS RealSecure/BlackICE products using Server Message Block (SMB).

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code leading to unauthorized administrative access to the target host. Denial of Service (DoS) is also possible.

--
Detailed Information:
RealSecure and BlackICE are host and network based Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems from ISS.

SMB is a client - server protocol used in sharing resources such as files, printers, ports, named pipes and other things, between machines on a network.

A vulnerability in the processing of SMB messages in ISS RealSecure/BlackICE exists due to a programming error which may present an attacker with the opportunity to exploit the host system and run code of their choosing on an affected system. The attacker may then cause a DoS condition in the service or possibly gain unauthorized access to the target host.

A long username in an authentication request causes a heap overflow to occur when an affected system tries to process the request.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply extra data in the username field of an authentication request to overflow the buffer, code of their choosing can then be run on the host system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
