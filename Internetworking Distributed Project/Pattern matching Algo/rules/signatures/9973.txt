Rule:

--
Sid:
9973

--
Summary:
This rule generates an event when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in the Microsoft TAPI service.

--
Impact:
Execution of arbitrary code leading to full administrator access of the machine. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
The Microsoft Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) provides the operating system with the interface needed for network communications. A buffer overflow condition exists in the service that may allow a remote attacker to execute code of their choosing on an affected host.

The issue lies in the LSetAppPriority function and may be exploited by accessing this function using DCERPC over SMB.

--
Affected Systems:
Windows 2000
Windows Server 2003

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply excess data in communications with the TAPI service to overflow a fixed length buffer and execute code of their choosing on the affected system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Expoit code exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
