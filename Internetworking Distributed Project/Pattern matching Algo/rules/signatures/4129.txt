Rule:

--
Sid:
4129

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Novell ZenWorks Remote Management Agent.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
Novell ZenWorks Remote Management Agent suffers from a programming error that may allow a remote and unauthenticated attacker to corrupt memory space to the extent that a DoS condition will be manifest.

The problem occurs because of insufficient checks on user supplied data prior to authentication. Excessive data may be supplied to the login process that is placed into a fixed length buffer, a classic buffer overflow condition is then met and the Agent may then suffer the DoS.

Note:
For this rule to generate an event correctly, port 1761 must be added to the stream4_reassemble line
