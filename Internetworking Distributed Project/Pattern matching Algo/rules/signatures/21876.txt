being used by the commonly known exploit kit known as Blackhole.

Impact: 
This rule indicates that one of the clients in HOME_NET was enticed to click
on a link that eventually lead to the Blackhole exploit kit.  The VRT has
observed this code embedded in normal pages that have been compromised all the
way to .html email attachments.

Detailed Information:
The Blackhole exploit kit uses many exploits to try and compromise the user's
system.  This alert simply looks for the initial landing page where the
javascript heap spray is loaded.  By using the IPS to block this initial
landing page, the client can be protected against further attack traffic such
as malicious PDF, Java downloads and Flash files.

Affected Systems:
The Blackhole exploit kit has been observed to be used against Windows and OSX
systems.

Little can be done to defend against this since it's so prevalent on the
Internet.  Ensure client is fully patched (to include flash, reader, java,
etc)  We recommend you move this rule to the "drop" state.
