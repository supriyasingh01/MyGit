Summary:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

--
Impact:
Unknown. This is an indication of anomalous behaviour between networked assets.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

The word count of the command header is invalid. SMB commands have pretty specific word counts and if the preprocessor sees a command with a word count that is invalid for that command, the preprocessor will generate this event.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems using NetBIOS DCERPC or SMB file and print sharing

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to specify an invalid word count for a particular SMB command.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.
