Sid:
3537

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
buffer overflow associated with the telnet client processing
of environment variable commands.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow on a telnet
client and permit the execution of arbitrary code at the
privilege level of the current user.

--
Detailed Information:
A telnet server can send environment variables to a connected client. If
a server sends a command with multiple escapes for the characters x01,
x02, x03 and xFF a fixed length buffer is exceeded and a buffer overflow
condition occurs.

This issue may be exploited by an attacker to execute code of their
choosing on a vulnerable client.

--
Affected Systems:
	Multiple Vendors.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send the environment commands with multiple escapes to
overflow the buffer followed by the code to be executed.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.

Use Secure Shell as an alternative method of remote access.
