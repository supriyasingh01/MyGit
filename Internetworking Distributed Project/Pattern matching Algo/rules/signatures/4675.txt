Rule:

--
Sid:
4675

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Macromedia Flash Player.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code leading to unauthorized administrative access to the target host.

--
Detailed Information:
A programming error in certain versions of the Macromedia Flash Player may allow an attacker to run code of their choosing on a victim host. The Player does not perform stringent bounds checking when processing flash movies, which may permit an attacker to include code of their choosing into a malicious flash format file.

In order to avoid potential evasion techniques, http_inspect should be configured with "flow_depth 0" so that all HTTP server response traffic is inspected.

WARNING
Setting flow_depth 0 will cause performance problems in some situations.
WARNING

--
Affected Systems:
Macromedia Flash Player 7 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to supply a malformed flash format file and entice a user to view it.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
Flash movie files can be compressed, this rule will not generate events in that instance.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the product.
