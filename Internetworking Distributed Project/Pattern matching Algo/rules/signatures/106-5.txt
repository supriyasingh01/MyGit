Sid:
106-5

--
Summary:
This event is generated when the pre-processor spp_rpc_decode detects network traffic that may constitute an attack. Specifically an rpc fragment with a zero length was detected.

--
Impact:
Possible Denial of Service.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the spp_rpc_decode pre-processor detects network traffic that may consititute an attack.

Some NFS daemons may suffer a denial of service (DoS) when they encounter RPC fragments with the length field set to zero.

This event can be controlled using the ((rpc_decode)) configuration options.

--
Affected Systems:
NFS Servers

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to supply RPC fragmented data to the server and set the fragment length to zero to cause the DoS to occur.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Check the target host for signs of compromise.
