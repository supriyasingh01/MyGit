Sid:
17554

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the ie is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 through 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted website using Javascript that creates, modifies, deletes, and accesses document objects using the tags property, which triggers heap corruption, related to uninitialized or deleted objects, a different issue than CVE-2007-3902 and CVE-2007-3903, and a variant of "Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability."

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
