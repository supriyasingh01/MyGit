Detailed Information:
A programming error in Microsoft Internet Explorer may allow an attacker to execute code of their choosing on a vulnerable host. Specifically, the error lies in the handling of hostnames longer than 256 characters.  When IE tries to process a hostname of this length or longer, the process may crash or cause the application to become unstable, presenting the attacker with an opportunity to execute code of their choosing on an affected system.

Affected Systems:
Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP service pack 2

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker need only supply the victim with a hostname part of a URL of 256 characters or more to cause the error to occur.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Supplying the hostname of sufficient length is simple, exploitation afterwards is difficult.

-- 
False Positives:

--
False Negatives:
