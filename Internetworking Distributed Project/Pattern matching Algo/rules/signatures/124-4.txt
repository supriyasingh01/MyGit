Sid:
124-4

--
Summary:
This event is generated when the smtp pre-processor detects an overly long argument to an smtp command.

--
Impact:
Unkown. Execution of arbitrary code leading to full administrator access of the machine may be possible. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
SMTP commands may be vulnerable to buffer overflows. Each command takes an argument, if this argument is too long a fixed length buffer may be overflowed allowing the attacker to execute code on an affected system.

Microsoft Exchange Servers are able to use extensions to the SMTP protocol to help communicate between Exchange servers. The "X-Link2State" verb is used to share routing information between Exchange servers.

A buffer overflow condition in the processing of this command may present an attacker with the opportunity to execute code of their choosing on an affected host.

While some of the extended verbs can be disabled easily by an Administrator, this particular command cannot. The affected dynamic link library (DLL) must be unregistered. Refer to MS05-021 for details on how to unregister the DLL.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Exchange Server 2000 sp3
Microsoft Exchange Server 2003
Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 sp1

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a malicious verb request using the "X-Link2State" verb to cause a buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code exists.

--
False Positives:
This event will generate events in an environment where the use of extended verbs between Exchange servers is commonplace.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Disable the use of the Microsoft SMTP extensions.
