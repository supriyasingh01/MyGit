Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in ruby on rails.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the passing of request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage unintended recursion, a related issue to CVE-2012-2695.

Attack Scenarios:
In an SQL injection attack, the attacker is able to coerce the application into running SQL queries of the attackers choosing. This can lead to a complete compromise of the data stored in the system as well as the attacker being able to gain administrative access to the application.

--
Ease of Attack:
Medium.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
