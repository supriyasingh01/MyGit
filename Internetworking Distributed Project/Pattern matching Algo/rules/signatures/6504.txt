Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Sophos Anti-Virus products. 

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Execution of code is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Sophos Anti-Virus fails to properly process Microsoft CAB files. A remote attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability to execute code of their choosing on the target host or cause a denial of service (DoS) against the Sophos Anti-Virus process.

This is a heap overflow vulnerability and is caused by the mishandling of CAB files. If a CAB file contains an excessive amount of folder descriptions a static buffer could be overflowed giving an attacker the opportunity to execute code of their choosing on an affected host.

Affected Systems:

--
Attack Scenarios:

-- 
Ease of Attack:
