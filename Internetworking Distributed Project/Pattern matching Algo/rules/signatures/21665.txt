Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in jre.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 2 and earlier, 6 Update 30 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 33 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Concurrency.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the February 2012 Oracle CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a downstream vendor and third party researchers that this issue occurs because the AtomicReferenceArray class implementation does not ensure that the array is of the Object[] type, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (JVM crash) or bypass Java sandbox restrictions.  NOTE: this issue was originally mapped to CVE-2011-3571, but that identifier was already assigned to a different issue.
