18324

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the ssl-vpn end-point interrogator/installer activex control is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Stack-based buffer overflow in SonicWALL SSL-VPN End-Point Interrogator/Installer ActiveX control (Aventail.EPInstaller) before 10.5.2 and 10.0.5 hotfix 3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long (1) CabURL and (2) Location arguments to the Install3rdPartyComponent method.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
