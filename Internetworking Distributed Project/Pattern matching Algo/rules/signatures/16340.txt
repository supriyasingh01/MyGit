Sid:
16340

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the windows media player is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Directory traversal vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Media Player 7.1 and Windows Media Player for Windows XP allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a skins file with a URL containing hex-encoded backslash characters (%5C) that causes an executable to be placed in an arbitrary location.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
