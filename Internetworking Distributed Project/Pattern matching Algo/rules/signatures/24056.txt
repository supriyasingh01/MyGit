Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in jdk.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 6 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted applet that bypasses SecurityManager restrictions by (1) using com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.findClass and leveraging an exception with the forName method to access restricted classes from arbitrary packages such as sun.awt.SunToolkit, then (2) using "reflection with a trusted immediate caller" to leverage the getField method to access and modify private fields, as exploited in the wild in August 2012 using Gondzz.class and Gondvv.class.

--
Attack Scenarios:
In an SQL injection attack, the attacker is able to coerce the application into running SQL queries of the attackers choosing. This can lead to a complete compromise of the data stored in the system as well as the attacker being able to gain administrative access to the application.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
