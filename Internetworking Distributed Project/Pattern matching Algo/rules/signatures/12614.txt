Sid:
12614

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the photo & imaging gallery is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Heap-based buffer overflow in the FileFind::FindFile method in (1) MFC42.dll, (2) MFC42u.dll, (3) MFC71.dll, and (4) MFC71u.dll in Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library 8.0, as used by the ListFiles method in hpqutil.dll 2.0.0.138 in Hewlett-Packard (HP) All-in-One and Photo & Imaging Gallery 1.1 and probably other products, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long first argument.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the photo & imaging gallery ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can host a web site that will return code of their choosing to the object when a victim clicks on a malicious link.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
