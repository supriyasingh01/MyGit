Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in database server.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Oracle Database Server 10g Release 2 allows local users to execute arbitrary SQL queries via the GET_DOMAIN_INDEX_METADATA function in the DBMS_EXPORT_EXTENSION package.  NOTE: this issue was originally linked to DB05 (CVE-2006-1870), but a reliable third party has claimed that it is not the same issue.  Based on details of the problem, the primary issue appears to be insecure privileges that facilitate the introduction of SQL in a way that is not releated to special characters, so this is not "SQL injection" per se.
