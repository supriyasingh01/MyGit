Sid:
105-4

--
Summary:
This event is generated when the pre-processor spp_bo detects network traffic that may constitute an attack. Specifically an attempt to compromise a host running Snort was detected.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of code may be possible. Denial of Service (DoS)

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the spp_bo pre-processor detects network traffic that may consititute an attack.

Certain versions of the Back Orifice preprocessor are vulnerable to a stack based buffer overflow condition. This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit the condition.

This event can be controlled using the ((bo)) configuration options.

--
Affected Systems:
Snort 2.4 through 2.4.2

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would need to craft packets and have them processed by a Snort instance using a vulnerable Back Orifice preprocessor.

--
Ease of Attack:
Difficult.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Check the target host for signs of compromise.

Upgrade to Snort 2.4.3 or higher.
