Sid:
14250

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the Eyeball Messenger SDK is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Buffer overflow in the CoVideoWindow.ocx ActiveX control 5.0.907.1 in Eyeball MessengerSDK, as used in products such as SiOL Komunikator 1.3, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large argument supplied to the BGColor method.  NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability in certain insecure configurations of Internet Explorer.

--
