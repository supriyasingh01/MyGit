Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in officescan corporate edition.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service.  Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Stack-based buffer overflow in Trend Micro OfficeScan Corporate Edition 8.0 Patch 2 build 1189 and earlier, and 7.3 Patch 3 build 1314 and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (crash) via a long encrypted password, which triggers the overflow in (1) cgiChkMasterPwd.exe, (2) policyserver.exe as reachable through cgiABLogon.exe, and other vectors.

--
Affected Systems:
trend micro officescan corporate edition 7.3 patch3 build1314
trend micro officescan corporate edition 8.0 patch2 build1189

Attack Scenarios:
Many types of buffer overflow exist, this is a generic term that may apply to many circumstances that result in an overflow of some kind. A parameter overflow for example, means that the attacker is able to supply data as a parameter to the execution of a program. When the program expands the supplied data, if the size of the parameter is not correctly checked, it may exceed a set limit allowing the attacker to overflow the buffer and write data into memory.
In a stack overflow, the attacker has the opportunity to overwrite a return memory address which allows them to point the return address to a memory location containing code they wish to execute. This allows the attacker to run code with the full privileges of the program in use. The attacker may also supply the address for a known important call, for example the system() call, with the arguments to the call on the stack. The stack also contains the stack pointer and the frame pointer, overwriting these values may lead to a write-what-where condition.
In a heap overflow, it is possible to overwrite function pointers that may be in memory. This may allow the attacker to execute code in memory by changing the function pointer to move to code of their choosing. This can occur even in programs that do not necessarily use function pointers since they may be left in memory at run time. The heap also contains user data which also becomes visible to the attacker.
