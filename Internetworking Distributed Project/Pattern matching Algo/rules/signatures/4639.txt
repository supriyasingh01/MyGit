Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Ethereal. In particular, this event indicates that the exploit was attempted via the "DISTCC dissector" function.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
Ethereal is a multi-platform network protocol analyser capable of displaying network data to the user in a graphical user interface.

An error in the processing of the payload length in a DISTCC packet may prevent an attacker with the opportunity to overflow a fixed length buffer and execute code of their choosing in the context of the user running Ethereal. This is normally the super-user or administrator when Ethereal is used to sniff data directly from a network interface.

--
Affected Systems:
	Ethereal 0.9.13 through 0.10.10

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker need to craft a DISTCC packet with a packet payload length of -1 to cause the overflow to manifest itself.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
