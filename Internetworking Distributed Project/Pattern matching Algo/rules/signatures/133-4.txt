Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

The SMB id does not equal "\xffSMB". Note that since the preprocessor does not yet support SMB2, id of "\xfeSMB" is turned away before an eventable point is reached.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems using NetBIOS DCERPC or SMB file and print sharing

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker would supply an SMB id that indicates SMB2, i.e. \xfeSMB

--
