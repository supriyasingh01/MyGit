--
Summary:
Certain versions of the DCE/RPC preprocessor included with Snort are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of code is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
The DCE/RPC preprocessor included with Snort is used to defragment DCE/RPC traffic before the main Snort detection engine processes the information.

Older versions of this preprocessor suffer from a programming error that may allow a remote attacker to execute code of their choosing on a vulnerable host when this preprocessor attempts to process DCE/RPC traffic.

This preprocessor can be disabled in the configuration file for Snort and the vulnerable code will not be loaded on startup.

--
Affected Systems:
DCE/RPC preprocessor included with Snort versions 2.6.1.2 and earlier

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker needs to supply a malformed dcerpc packet to the vulnerable preprocessor.

--
Ease of Attack:
Medium.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest version of the DCE/RPC preprocessor.

Disable the preprocessor in snort.conf
