Sid:
14635

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the digital_image_suite is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Integer overflow in gdiplus.dll in GDI+ in Microsoft Office XP SP3, Office 2003 SP2 and SP3, 2007 Microsoft Office System Gold and SP1, Visio 2002 SP2, PowerPoint Viewer 2003, Works 8, Digital Image Suite 2006, SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services SP2, SQL Server 2005 SP2, Report Viewer 2005 SP1 and 2008, and Forefront Client Security 1.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a BMP image file with a malformed BitMapInfoHeader that triggers a buffer overflow, aka "GDI+ BMP Integer Overflow Vulnerability."

--
