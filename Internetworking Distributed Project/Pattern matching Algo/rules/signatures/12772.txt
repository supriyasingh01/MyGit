Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the PPStream is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Buffer overflow in the PowerPlayer.dll ActiveX control in PPStream 2.0.1.3829 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long Logo parameter.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the PPStream ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
