Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in firefox.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
Multiple vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.8, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.8, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.5 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted HTML that triggers memory corruption or assert errors.

--
Affected Systems:
mozilla firefox 2.0.0.7

--
Attack Scenarios:
In an integer overflow attack, the attacker is able to control an integer value that can be made to be too large to store appropriately. The value may then wrap to become a small or negative value. At best this may cause a Denial of Service to occur, at worst this could lead to a buffer overflow which then allows the attacker to execute code on the system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Difficult.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
