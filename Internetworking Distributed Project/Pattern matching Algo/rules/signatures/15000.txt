--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the debug_diagnostic_tool is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

The DebugDiag ActiveX control in CrashHangExt.dll, possibly 1.0, in Microsoft Debug Diagnostic Tool allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and Internet Explorer 6.0 crash) via a large negative integer argument to the GetEntryPointForThread method.  NOTE: this issue might only be exploitable in limited environments or non-default browser settings.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the debug_diagnostic_tool ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can host a web site that will return code of their choosing to the object when a victim clicks on a malicious link.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
