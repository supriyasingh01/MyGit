Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the file Doctodep.btr on a host running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) with Frontpage Extensions. 

--
Impact:
Information gathering possible administrator access.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the file Doctodep.btr on a host running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) with Frontpage Extensions. 

The attacker may be trying to gain information on the IIS implementation on the host, this may be the prelude to an attack against that host using that information.

Some applications may store sensitive information such as database connections, user information, passwords and customer information in files accessible via a web interface. Care should be taken to ensure these files are not accessible to external sources.

The file Doctodep.btr is a dependancy database for applications using the FrontPage Extensions on the server and may contain sensitive information.

--
Affected Systems:
Any host using IIS with FrontPage Extensions.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can retrieve a sensitive file containing information on the IIS implementation. The attacker might then gain administrator access to the site, deface the content or gain access to a database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Check the IIS implementation on the host. Ensure all measures have been taken to deny access to sensitive files.

Ensure that the IIS implementation is fully patched.

Ensure that the underlying operating system is fully patched.

Employ strategies to harden the IIS implementation and operating system.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
