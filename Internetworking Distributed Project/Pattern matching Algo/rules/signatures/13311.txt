Sid
13311

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in Mod Proxy for Apache.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. Complete admin access.

--
Detailed Information:
The date handling code in modules/proxy/proxy_util.c (mod_proxy) in Apache 2.3.0, when using a threaded MPM, allows remote origin servers to cause a denial of service (caching forward proxy process crash) via crafted date headers that trigger a buffer over-read.

--
Affected Systems:
Apache http_server 2.3.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker need only send a long parameter for the "Last-Modified" header to the server running mod_proxy.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
Microsoft IIS servers may send a non-RFC compliant date in the Last-Modified header that may cause this rule to generate an event. See RFC 2616 section 3 for details on the format this header is supposed to take.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
