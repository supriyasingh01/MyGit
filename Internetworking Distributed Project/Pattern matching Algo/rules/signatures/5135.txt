--
Impact:
Possible remote execution of arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in LSASS that may present an attacker with the opportunity to execute code of their choosing on an affected host.

The problem lies in an unchecked buffer in the LSASS service, suscessful exploitation may present the attacker with the opportunity to gain control of the affected system.

This event indicates that an attempt was made to access the DsRolerGetPrimaryDomainInformation function on a host, this may indicate that an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the LSASS service may be iminent.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches

Use a packet filtering firewall to deny access to TCP and UDP ports 135 and 445, UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP ports 139 and 593 from resources outside the protected network.

Access should also be denied to ephemeral ports and any other ports used by RPC services from sources external to the protected network.
