Sid:
3995

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability is the Microsoft Plug and Play subsystem on a host.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of code is possible leading to full system
compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
A programming error in the Plug and Play (PnP) service used by
Microsoft Windows machines can present a remote attacker with the
opportunity to overflow a fixed length buffer, execute code on the
vulnerable system and escalate privileges on the host to the extent
that they could take complete control of the affected machine.

Specifically this event is generated when the PNP_QueryResConfList
operation is targeted via the dcerpc_request function.

--
Affected Systems:
  Microsoft Windows 2000
  Microsoft Windows XP
  Microsoft Windows 2003

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker merely needs to send extra data to the PnP service to
overflow the buffer and execute code of their choosing on the affected
system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is freely available. A worm is known to exist that
exploits this vulnerability.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Disallow access to ports 139 and 445 from sources external to the
protected network.

Consider disabling the use of those ports completely on Windows based
networks.
