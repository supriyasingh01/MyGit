--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches

Use a packet filtering firewall to deny access to TCP and UDP ports 135 and 445, UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP ports 139 and 593 from resources outside the protected network.

Access should also be denied to ephemeral ports and any other ports used by RPC services from sources external to the protected network.
