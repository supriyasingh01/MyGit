Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in http server.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Information disclosure. Loss of integrity. 

--
Detailed Information:
modules/arch/win32/mod_isapi.c in mod_isapi in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.37 through 2.0.63, 2.2.0 through 2.2.14, and 2.3.x before 2.3.7, when running on Windows, does not ensure that request processing is complete before calling isapi_unload for an ISAPI .dll module, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors related to a crafted request, a reset packet, and "orphaned callback pointers."
