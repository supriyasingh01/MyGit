Sid:
17570

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the firefox is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.13, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.13, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.9 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to the layout engine.

NOTE: For this detection to work comprehensively, the flow depth setting in the HTTP Inspect preprocessor must be set to 0
