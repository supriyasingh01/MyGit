Summary:

Impact:
Unknown. This is an indication of anomalous behaviour between networked assets.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the dcerpc2 preprocessor detects anomalous network traffic.

The preprocessor will generate this event if a non-last fragment is less than the size of the negotiated maximum fragment length. Most evasion techniques try to fragment the data as much as possible and usually each fragment comes well below the negotiated transmit size.

This event can be controlled using the ((dce2)) configuration options.
