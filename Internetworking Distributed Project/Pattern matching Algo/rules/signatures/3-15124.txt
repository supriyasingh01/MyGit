Sid:
3-15124

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the windows_media_format_runtime is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Microsoft Windows Media Player 6.4, Windows Media Format Runtime 7.1 through 11, and Windows Media Services 4.1, 9, and 2008 do not properly use the Service Principal Name (SPN) identifier when validating replies to authentication requests, which allows remote servers to execute arbitrary code via vectors that employ NTLM credential reflection, aka "SPN Vulnerability."

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows systems using the windows_media_format_runtime ActiveX control

--
Attack Scenarios:
In an integer overflow attack, the attacker is able to control an integer value that can be made to be too large to store appropriately. The value may then wrap to become a small or negative value. At best this may cause a Denial of Service to occur, at worst this could lead to a buffer overflow which then allows the attacker to execute code on the system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
