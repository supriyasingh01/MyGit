Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with Veritas Backup Agent authentication.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary commands may be possible.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in Veritas Backup Agent authentication software.
This software uses Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) to
communicate between clients and servers. Authentication is required to
successfully connect. If an overly long password value is supplied during
authentication, a buffer overflow may occur than can present an attacker
with the opportunity to execute code of their choosing.
