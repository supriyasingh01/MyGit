Sid:
3533

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
buffer overflow associated with the telnet client processing
of the LINEMODE option.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow on a telnet
client and permit the execution of arbitrary code at the
privilege level of the current user.

--
Detailed Information:
A telnet client and server can negotiate various options such as
the character set to be used in the communication exchange. One
particular option is the LINEMODE.  Telnet LINEMODE provides a
method of processing terminal characters by the client of a
telnet connection.

The LINEMODE option has a sub-option Special Local Character (SLC)
that identifies the special characters in the telnet exchange.  A
fixed-sized buffer is allocated to store the values sent in this
command.  No validation is performed to ensure that the values
received by the client fit in the allocated buffer, possibly causing
a buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary code on the client
at the privilege level of the current user.

--
Affected Systems:
See the original report by iDEFENSE referenced below.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to a malicious telnet server
and return a LINEMODE command with an overly long set of
SLC values.  This can cause an overflow, enabling execution
of arbitrary code on a vulnerable client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.

Use Secure Shell as an alternative method of remote access.
