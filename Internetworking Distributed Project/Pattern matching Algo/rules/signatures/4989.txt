--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server 2000.

--
Impact:
Serious. A successful attack may allow an unauthorized user access, cause a  denial of service or buffer overrun with the subsequent execution of arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
Versions of Microsofts implementation of SQL server running the  resolution service are subject to multiple buffer overflows.

It is possible to overwrite memory with data of the attackers choosing, resulting in a denial of service or possible code execution. This is done by sending carefully crafted packets to the resolution service running on the server.

It is also possible for the attacker to cause a denial of service by sending a spoofed packet purporting to be from one SQL server to another. The resulting exchange between the two servers could result in a denial of service.
