--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in an ActiveX control.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code with system level privileges on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls that may present an attacker with the opportunity to run code of their choosing on a host.

In particular, this event is generated when a call to the housecall is made. This may indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in that ActiveX control which may lead to a system compromise.

Use-after-free vulnerability in the Trend Micro HouseCall ActiveX control 6.51.0.1028 and 6.6.0.1278 in Housecall_ActiveX.dll allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted notifyOnLoadNative callback function.
